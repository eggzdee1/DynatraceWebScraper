I am fairly good with the Dynatrace API V2 and with Data Explorer. However, pulling OpenShift statistics in Dynatrace is still a challenge to me.My question is - Can you pull OpenShift service statistics by Kubernetes namespace?It works fine if I do it by tag and service name.builtin:service.response.time:filter(and(and(in("dt.entity.service",entitySelector("type(service),tag(~"OpenShift Namespace:blah-blah~")")),in("dt.entity.service",entitySelector("type(service),entityName.contains(~"blah-blah-service-1~")"))))):splitBy("dt.entity.service"):avg:sort(value(avg,descending)):limit(20)Any help greatly appreciated.Lou

So yeah, very simple query that I pretty much copied from the Grail Examples in the Dynatrace documentation: timeseries usage=avg(dt.host.cpu.usage),
    by:{dt.entity.host},
    filter:{
      dt.entity.host in [
       fetch dt.entity.host
      | fieldsAdd hostGroupName
      | filter hostGroupName == "HOST_GROUP_A"
      | fields id
       ]
    }  That returns back the two hosts in that host group along with their entityId as the names.  However, if I change the | fields id line to | fields entity.name  I get no results... I changed nothing else other than that line.  Why in the world can I not get the name of the hosts instead? If I do a simple query like this: fetch dt.entity.host
| filter hostGroupName == "HOST_GROUP_A" I get back the two hosts in that group and it shows that each host has two fields, entity.name and id.  So why can't I use entity.name in the fields line?I even tried doing a fieldsAdd entity.name and that doesn't work either.  I tried putting the fieldsAdd both inside of and outside of the filter block, but nothing works.  I get no results if I don't use id.  But who wants to have id on the charts?  Nobody will know which host is which...

I need to run a query with 3 conditions for the ":filter" command, and I am having a hard time with the syntax.This is the base query that I am working off of:1    builtin:tech.generic.mem.workingSetSize2    :filter(in("dt.entity.process_group_instance",entitySelector("type(process_group_instance),entityName(~"Oracle Database~")")))3    :parents:splitBy("dt.entity.host"):avg:sort(value(avg,descending))4    :filter(in("dt.entity.host", entitySelector("type(~"HOST~"),tag(~"TYPE:Oracle Database Server~")")))It returns all results without any issues, but I need to add another condition for filtering. I have built the condition separately and I have tried to add the line below, to no avail:5    :filter(in("dt.entity.host", entitySelector("type(~"HOST~"),tag(~"Capability:Global Money Transfer~")")))I am assuming that there might be a conflict between the multiple ":filter" instances and the way around would be using the AND operator, but I am struggling so hard with the syntax that I was hoping to get a little guidance from the community.

Hey,
I am now deciding whether to use metrics API or DQL to query metrics.  But now, I am facing a problem that I can't find some metrics using DQL. (e.g. builtin:host.cpu.load15m)
Is that all metrics that can be queried by metrics selector can also be use DQL to query?
 
Thanks.

I'm trying to run a query using Data Explorer that involves 2 separate metrics. The reason for this is because I want the different metrics to have differing thresholds. However, it will only let me run the query for 1 metric at a time, not both in conjunction, even though both are the same, just looking at different applications. Is there a solution or way of being able to run 2 metrics together at the same time using a honeycomb in Data Explorer?

Via "Analyse Process Connections" we can see which host/process is calling our host and what volumes we are talking about. That's great but it's quite deep dive.For a certain fileserver we want to keep track of the incoming traffic and where it comes from. There are a few metrics for that but none of them have a "calling host" dimension or something like that. See builtin:host.net.nic.trafficIn can be split by host and NIC. But that doesn't tell where the traffic comes from. We know the data is available because we have those details via "Analyse Process Connections".Is this feasible? And how? For this particular service we want it on a dashboard. Maybe even create alerts when certain incoming spikes arise.

Hi.  I'm a new Dynatrace user so please bear with me as I haven't seen the examples.  I am trying to parse a custom application's log within Dynatrace and set alerts based on various fields and keywords within the log file.  The issue is that the custom application produces text files with a *.txt format and separated the fields within the log with a pipe delimiter.  The log is created with a timestamp at the end of the file each hour (ie log file name.YYMMDDHHMM.text).  I haven't tried it yet or seen many examples of this (yet or maybe I'm not looking in the right place).  Do I use the custom log ingestion process to ingest the file and then use the DPL to parse the custom format?  Or, would it be better for me to write a KSH script rename the 'crazy' log file into something that Dynatrace can read and parse more easily (ie make it look like a Windows System log file)?.Any guidance would be appreciated.  Thanks!

Hi everyone,Yesterday we found several alerts which appeared in problem console several minutes later than the problem was detected. One of them  didn´t show in the console up to an hour later. Reading this URL from the documentation https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform/davis-ai/problem-and-root-cause/problem-lifecycle  it's read "As the event start analysis timestamp represents the earliest point in time when the violating state was observed, the event end analysis timestamp represents the point in time after all necessary violation samples are collected and the Davis problem is raised. Because each event involved in the problem uses a sliding window, .. ..." I think that the delay in showing the alert in problem console is due to this sliding window and the analysis timestamp. Is it possible to configure this sliding window like we can do for metric events? Can someone explain us why this can happened and how to fix this behaviour?For us this behaviour is very problematic because the final users are detecting the problems before us and we can't give a quick solution to fix the issue.Thanks in advance.Regards,Elena.

Dear Community, I'm interested in your feedback as well.  The moment latest Dynatrace was released to our tenant I got calls of uncertain excitement from my users.  I told them it was safe to turn it on and it's simple to toggle back and forth incase things don't work out.  This is an early release so look around, let me know how it goes, but improvements are coming.
I received some positive comments regarding the new look and feel. A complaint of the way legacy pages were not converted yet, making for a SolarWinds APM like inconsistent UI feel.
Within 60 minutes though I started getting emails and Teams messages complaining of how difficult it was to access their metrics with the new dashboards and notebooks.  "It looks pretty, but I spent 2 hours unsuccessfully trying to recreate charts I already have in my classic dashboards", "It's too difficult to find metrics in the new structure", "There are not enough examples to guide us", "There should be an in place linter to help fix queries", "Where is the Data Explorer for Grails?", "I am finding it difficult to access my metrics with this code. Where is the visual graph building like Data Explorer".
I've instructed them that it's nice that we are able to experience latest Dynatrace so early, we'll send the feedback to Dynatrace, and lets hope improvements arrive soon.
I would though like to hear how other Community Members are doing. Maybe those Early Adopters could tell us they had similar initial reactions but it got better.

 Rocket Woman , I guess that's what you can call our Member of the Month for October selected from the customers and partners group. Just reading this article, it’s easy to feel how passionate about work and life overall Marina is.
Passion develops as we learn more about something. We have the power to create motivation in ourselves, and “starting to do” is the first step to achieving it. A strong desire to explore and act is something that @marina_pollehn shows in many areas. Also here, on Community, where she actively helps other Dynatrace users.
I could say more, but I think Marina’s words will speak for themselves best. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Can you share some details about your past? What is your story, and how it happened that you decided to work in the IT / APM area? When I was about to graduate high school in Hamburg (Germany), I dreamed of becoming a public sector consultant and evaluating policy making – with the big wish to work for the United Nations or the European Union. In between, I had a few impulsive moments where I almost signed up for the exam to become an air traffic controller – I really did not know where this urge suddenly came from. Looking back – as it is also a form of monitoring – it makes sense to me now .
Other than that, I had a big wish to start with IT as a side hobby, but many of my attempts to join a course or to get started with it did not really work out. In high school, the computer science elective was discontinued in my grade, and attending one at another school was too big of a clash with my timetable. So, after graduating, in line with my public sector consulting goal, I started studying economics in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. In my 3rd year of bachelor’s, I signed up for a minor in computer science. I was so passionate about it that I convinced my best friend to sign up for the minor, too. Unfortunately, it was a lottery, and they didn’t have space anymore – so she got in, and I didn’t. I decided to ask her during every break about what they’ve learned, and it only made me more eager to get into IT. At the same time, next to my minor, I joined my university’s ‘Turing Club’ to learn some web development. After finishing my bachelor's, I started with two masters: International Economics and Business Information Management (with a focus on Data Science). At that point, I still saw myself working in economics and saw IT as a cool hobby to have a second master’s in. Well, I was very wrong. After a student job in data engineering at Boskalis (a Dutch maritime engineering company), which only made me more enthusiastic about the field, I started working as a Digital Performance Consultant. Not an air traffic controller – but at least some pilot experience.
Can you tell us a little bit about your professional life? Where do you work, and what do you do in your job? And how does Dynatrace fit into the picture?For the last 3 years, I have been working at Eviden (formerly Atos) – a large IT services and consulting company located in Amstelveen (close to the more famous Amsterdam) in the Netherlands. There I started directly as a Digital Performance Management Consultant. We're a full-service provider, which assists customers with their entire monitoring journey – mostly with Dynatrace. This can include configurations, hosting, and consultancy for almost every type of IT landscape – basically anything you can monitor with Dynatrace. 
My job consists of a mix of operations and project tasks (usually the onboarding of an entire application including all configurations), ranging from creating metrics and configuring extensions to giving Dynatrace trainings and workshops. Two tasks I really enjoy are coaching new colleagues and helping them with their first steps within Dynatrace and the team, as well as giving demos to new potential customers who are often fascinated with the capabilities of the software. 
Another aspect that is especially fun about my job is that I get to speak all three languages (German, Dutch, and English), which I know fluently because I work with different customers from all over the world. I also enjoy how every customer environment and request is different, which gives me the chance to explore as many aspects of Dynatrace as possible. So many that I am now allowed to call myself a certified Dynatrace Professional. LEFT: Bachelor Graduation Day with my sister (who unfortunately lives 500km away from me). / RIGHT: We find celebrating birthdays in the office very important.
What was the biggest challenge Dynatrace helped you to overcome? 
One of the most impressive applications I set up Dynatrace monitoring for was a survey form for uploading COVID test results by the Australian government. The constant global availability of the application was essential to collect COVID data at any time, enable international travel, and avoid user frustration. We tested the availability with multiple synthetic (browser clickpath) monitors at a high frequency and multiple locations. Furthermore, the customer wanted more detailed insights into the bounce rate and drop-off locations. Next to visualizing the expected user journey through the survey with the user action funnel and providing the customer with insights into different failure rate and response time metrics, I also decided to explore the actual user journey further with the Sankey chart. This showed us how and how many users deviated from the expected journey and which application pages they returned to in between. To me, the project was very inspiring due to its social relevance and time criticality. I was impressed with how quickly we could set up the entire Dynatrace monitoring (we had a maximum of two weeks), including everything up to Session Replay, data masking, dashboards, alerting, synthetics, and many more functionalities.
What brought you to our Community? What made you stay? What best advice can you give someone who just started using Community?Initially, I started out as a silent observer in the Community. If I could not find something specific in the Dynatrace documentation, I would just roam around the Community, and quite often, someone else already had the same question answered. After a year, I came back with my own questions. I still remember that the first question I had was related to ignoring specific types of request errors for web applications.
My advice is to ask whatever is on your mind. I sometimes use the Community to get a second opinion on something.  Also, you don’t need to know every little detail about Dynatrace (trust me, that’s technically impossible) to contribute to the Community. Sometimes something might be very best-practice and normal in your way of working and be completely new to someone else, even if they have been working with Dynatrace way longer than you. 
The aspect I love the most is that the Community can be an excellent challenge for yourself. When answering a question, you often need to do some testing on your own or you need to research until you finally find the solution you had hoped for. This keeps me curious and up-to-date.
And – the last piece of advice – make sure you use the product ideas. If I encounter something in Dynatrace which could be done more efficiently I just directly suggest it as a product idea. Dynatrace does a great job at integrating minor improvements very quickly and including other ideas in their long-term strategy, so sharing feedback can really pay off.Tell us something about you that most people don’t know. What is your biggest joy or passion in life? I am a person with too many hobbies and interests. I would say that dancing is my biggest passion. When I was 13, I started with Ballroom and Latin dancing but paused for 5 years after because my friends quit (biggest regret). When I started university, I signed up for dance classes again, and on the ‘blind date’ night, I met my dance partner, who became a very good friend of mine. Together we danced for 5 years and even went to the Dutch and European student tournaments – some cool memories of dancing 12 hours a day with my feet becoming 2 sizes larger afterwards. Since he moved to London, I have tried different dance styles. I have been learning salsa for a year and since last September, you can find me in an aerial dance studio for 2-5 hours a week enjoying the combination of dance and acrobatics.

 If I am not dancing, you can find me in my ‘nerd-mode’ reading pen & paper manuals (some of you might only know it as D&D) and of course, also playing it (VTM and Aborea) online with friends once a month. Besides that, I have an addiction to water sports like SUPping and kayaking. Last year I spent a week traveling through one of the Dutch national parks on a stand-up paddle board, paddling from sunrise until sundown with the most contradicting weather conditions. This taught me that you can fit everything you need in life on a surfboard and that a digital detox once per year is quite healthy for the mind.
 LEFT: Relaxing during my family’s yearly Denmark vacation – ‘even uitwaaien’ how the Dutch call it. RIGHT: Stand-up paddling through the Dutch national park ‘Weerribben-Wieden’.
What’s one thing on your bucket list? Your dream?Again, just one big dream or plan would not suit me well – there are simply too many awesome things in life. One big dream, speaking a 3rd language fluently – in my case, Dutch - I made come true over the past 7 years. A lovely next challenge would be learning a Scandinavian language – most likely Danish – as it is my favorite country to travel to.
As a travel goal, Greenland is very high on my list. I would love to plan a kayak trip for multiple weeks, including the Ilulissat Icefjord, and would have high hopes of seeing a musk ox and polar bear in real life – with some healthy distance, preferably. In Canada, I already had the chance to go dog sledding when I was 15. That’s a dream that I would also want to relive in Greenland.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Marina, we can only say continue all the great things you do.

I'm a little confused by the documentation below. For 2.0 extensions it states the below. To me this is saying it is needed otherwise the extension will not work, but that is not the case. I've created a JMX extension and added it to a bunch of hosts. I have not added the certificate but we are getting data from the extension. Can someone please clarify this?Each host running your extension, whether OneAgent or ActiveGate, needs to have the root certificate saved in a dedicated directory. This extra step is required to enhance the security of the Extensions 2.0 framework.https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/extensions20/sign-extension#upload

Hello community,
i want to enable RUM V2 in my environment, but there are few informations in documentation about it (maybe because it's an early adopter). In screen below there is a switch On/Off:

 
So, i have some questions:
 
1) There is a best practice to enable it? Or just switch On?
2) There is a detailed documentation about it?
3) There is a Process Group Override section, so i can select a specific process group when i enable RUM V2 or i must enable it for whole environment?

4) If i enable RUM V2, i must restart what? Processes, or whole VM?
 
Anyone have some information about it? Thanks so much

In a data explorer graph with the process CPU with some filters applied and split by process group instance and host: The 13th of September the CPU dropped a lot (expected behavior). However, even though some processes are still consuming small amounts of CPU, nothing appears in the graph.This is one example:  And this is what the data explorer graph shows:  When the CPU is around 0.15% it doesn't show anything in the graph. Why is this? Is there a way to see this information even though the percentage is small?

Our SAP Extension is going blank on the live data feed and even showing the wrong custom device name. 
Went into settings, monitored technologies, the SAP Application server, and looked at the endpoint with the wrong endpoint it is disabled. We updated it in case there is a sync issue, however, in Technologes & Processes, it is that endpoint that is shown for Remote extension endpoints.
The correct endpoint is shown OK status and we refreshed but it is not even showing in Technologies & Processes. When I go to Data Explorer and pull up Dialog Response time by custom device, this correct endpoint custom device is not generating any data.
 
For monitoring interruptions what should be done for SAP ABAP extension? How can we check if there is a Dynatrace configuration issue somewhere or if its SAP system issue?

 Destiny… the power that predetermines and orders the course of events. Some things, people, and circumstances come to us even though we defend ourselves against them. In many situations, when we stop opposing them, they can lead us to the places where we should be, surrounded by people who are our best match. And sometimes we don't have to look far for what is written for us.

I always wanted to know how things work and what’s inside. I loved to disassemble old radios or toys. So, from my infant days, I was already attached to technology. Therefore, I went to an IT high school and subsequently did a bachelor's and master’s in business informatics in Linz.
After university, I was looking for a new job in IT. I had never heard about Dynatrace, even though the office was close to the university. A head-hunter got my number and reached out to me a couple of times. Initially, I was reluctant to go to an interview, but then I went to one. As soon as they explained what kind of product they were building, I thought, “WOW, amazing,” and became a part of Dynatrace. LEFT: Recording DQL videos in our studio. / RIGHT: Enjoying the red desert in the Emirates.Can you tell us a little bit about your job? What interesting things you’re working on that you can share? I am part of a team which is called “Platform Enablement Team.” We’re creating content, doing workshops, and answering questions about how to build Dynatrace Apps and DQL. Furthermore, we're also fostering the Dynatrace developer community called Developer Forum. Internally, we have enabled more than 400 colleagues on how to make Dynatrace Apps. Since I have touchpoints with so many different people, it is really interesting for me to see what kind of use cases someone would like to solve with the Dynatrace platform.
What makes you excited about being a part of the Dynatrace?On the one hand, it is our product – a best-in-class solution using cutting-edge technologies. So new technology trends are being quickly adopted. On the other side is the Dynatrace culture – the company has tripled in size since I joined, and I still feel the same spirit.

What best advice can you give someone who just started using Community?Community is all about exchanging ideas and helping each other. As it is crucial for us as a company to identify our customer needs, one part of my job is giving feedback to the R&D teams. With the launch of the Developer Forum as part of the Community, we're also trying to bring Dynatrace developers with non-Dynatrace developers closer together. So, you can engage with Dynatrace developers – how cool is that?  
For someone who has just started using the Community – don’t hesitate to ask questions. There are no stupid questions.
Tell us something about you that most people don’t know. What is your biggest joy or passion in life?I don’t have one big passion, there are a couple of them. I love to spend weekends outside – be it in the mountains doing sports or traveling.

I heard people on the shore shouting, “Shark, shark!”, and swam as fast as I could to the beach and noticed that the fisher had a shark on the hook 10m next to me snorkeling. Also, since I am interested in tech, I have quite some gadgets at home like a drone, NAS (network attached storage), 360 action camera, Nintendo Switch, gimbal…

Hi All,
 
I recently did a OneAgent deployment to a large volume of Virtual Machines in Azure via PowerShell and noticed that the Dynatrace Documentation doesnt cover how to install the Dynatrace OneAgent VM Extension in Infrastructure Only Mode. (The Documentation uses the depreciated AzureRM Module and doesnt cover the syntax for the settings to enable Infrastructure Only mode on installation). Thought i would drop this here in case anyone runs into the same issue, hopefully it makes someone's life a little easier.
 
This script can be modified to suit any specific situation, in this example you can simply export the VM's from the Virtual Machine blade in Azure into a csv (in this case i targeted windows VM's) and change the column header "Resource Group" to "ResourceGroup". Good for large deployments where you only want to target a single subscription at a time for a rollout. Simply fill in the < >
 
Remember to Import the .Az module and use Get-AzSubscription to find the correct subscription ID and then Set-AzContext -Subscription <Subscription ID Here> to set the context to the desired subscription
 
PowerShell Script:
$Importfile=Import-csv <File Path Here>
Foreach ($Import in $Imports) {
$ResourceGroup=$Import.ResourceGroup
$VMName=$Import.Name
$Location=$Import.Location
 
Set-AzVmExtension -Name Dynatrace.OneAgent -Publisher dynatrace.ruxit -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup -Location $Location -VMName $Name -ExtensionType "oneAgentwindows" -TypeHandlerVersion "1.0" -NoWait -Settings @{ "tenantId"="<TenantID Here>"; "token"="<Token Here>"; "enableLogAnalytics"="yes"; “installerArguments”=”--set-infra-only=true --set-host-group=<Host Group Name Here>” } -erroraction continue }

Hello all, I have a question about a combination of Dynatrace and OpenTelemetry. By way of testing I've created a simple Spring application with one endpoint which is instrumented with OpenTelemetry(manually instrumented) and has a Dynatrace OneAgent on the host which also injects into the application.Everything seems to be working and I get all the expected data into Dynatrace.I do have two questions I hope someone can help me with. For all Span Attributes the following message is shown in Dynatrace: "initial value not set" and there is a general message on the purepath as well with "Some attributes have not been set at span start. They cannot be used in Span capturing settings". I tried both custom Attributes and SemanticAttributes set like below and both have the same result.  parentSpan.setAttribute("http.dynaguild.name", name);
parentSpan.setAttribute(SemanticAttributes.ENDUSER_SCOPE, name);   Any idea what I am doing wrong, or what I should set? And the second question is about nesting. I have two spans, a parent span and a child span. I think I set the parenting correctly but in Dynatrace they are not nested. I think all that is required is the following:  Span childSpan = tracer.spanBuilder("child-span").setParent(Context.current().with(parentSpan)).startSpan();    Any ideas? Thanks in advance and kind regards,Erik

Hey there,
I'am just stepping into the depths of Dynatrace and now I got a problem:
How to ingest alphanumerical values into Dynatrace and display them on the dashboard?
1. this works because the value is numerical
/opt/dynatrace/oneagent/agent/tools/dynatrace_ingest "anz_bla.count `ls -ltr /tmp/anz/bla* | wc -l`" 
This script counts files in /tmp/anz/. With this metric (anz.bla.count.gauge) I can use nearly any tile I want.
 
2. that doesn't work, because of the string value
/opt/dynatrace/oneagent/agent/tools/dynatrace_ingest "timestamp_host `date`"
There is no reaction in Dynatrace.
 
Now my questions:
How can I ingest alphanumerical values? date is only an example.
How can I display alphanumerical values in dashboards? Table, Textbox, or something else. Graph, I assume, would not work ;-). The workaround with writing a log file should work, but I cannot test this in my sandbox.
Is there a way to manipulate values when they come in? I.E. Value comes in -> Script changes input "OK" to 1 -> manipulated value is being used by Dynatrace.
Thanks a lot in advance.

It seems today when you pull in cloudwatch metrics for things like ebs or efs the detected name that shows is the ID itself rather than the name you provide in AWS (example of ID is below). The name does get pulled in as a tag because the name of the efs or ebs is applied as a tag automatically it seems, if you provide a name.
Rather than show the ID, is there a way to show the name itself so that problems that get created have this name / more friendly human understandable name?

Hello Community people! more and more often I'm asked about big enough data extraction from Dynatrace.I usually work with Dynatrace api v2 and Power Query (M) from Microsoft.When I hit the limit for the data extracted I try to segment the api query itself in order to not have the nextPageKey cursor but sometime it is inevitable.So my question is: how do you usally manage to extract data when nextPageKey is showed in your response load?Are you scripting your costum solution in order to continue the extraction automatically? (without everytime re-typing the uri with the nextPageKey cursor?) What other tools do you usually use in order to extract the data with Dynatrace apiv2?Thanks in advance to everybody who will join this conversation and will contribute,Regards

Hello everyone
I am facing a problem of Unexpected low traffic completely every day.When this problem occurs, inspecting the page through the browser and going to the network, I realize that the agent is not in the "ruxitagentjs" frontend. What could it be?
This problem usually stays for 1-2 hours on average and then returns normally. The root cause points to the application itself.

Background: As we move closer and closer to the Holiday season a common issue is suppressing certain alerts that don't reflect a problem. For example, Low User Traffic on a holiday. There have been multiple RFEs to address these type of problems. While we wait for a direct solution from Dynatrace I'd like to offer my Pro Tip on how to handle these unwanted alerts on certain days etc... 
First step: Define what it is that you want to stop alerts on, it could be one thing, or a collection of things. But we need to know what you want to exclude. Lets use this Scenario - Your organization decided to leverage a federal holiday to roll out a bunch of patches. As a result, we fully expect 2 problems. First being 'Unexpected Low user traffic' and Second being 'High CPU Usage'.  
Second Step: Understand how your organization alerts. Some organizations use privatized alerting, meaning that there is an alert profile and an alert integration that shoots out an email to the defined recipients. Other organizations use an event handler, such as Moogsoft, Servicenow etc.. Never the less, you'll need to understand where your alerts go and how they alert to your customers. For this case we will use an event handler as the method can be used for privatized alerting as well. 
Third Step: Now that you know what you want to suppress, and you know what type of notification delivery method your organization uses, we need to validate what alert profiles these 'alerts' you want to suppress apply to. This is easier when you have an event handler because the average organization sends everything to it. So lets go into Dynatrace and look for the low user traffic: 
 
Now we know what alert profiles qualify for this event. And since we are using an event handler in this scenario, I know that the alert profile starting with "N" goes to our event handler. That alert profile is now my target. 
Fourth Step: Lets go into that Alert Profile so we can make the changes needed to suppress the qualification of the alerts. Looking at the Alert Profile we can see al the rules are set to immediately alert, but to remove an alert aspect we want to go into "Add Event Filter"
 
Fifth Step: The key to this is the "Negate" function. We can select a predefined event, basically anything out of the box with Dynatrace. Then we select that out of the box event we want to target. And the final aspect is to set the 'Negate' to ignore issues that fall under Low Traffic. Now our scenario stated that their is going to be high CPU as well, So ill just make two negate rules: 
 
 
Now the system will qualify alerts that pertain to the defined Management Zone, AND any defined severity rule, AND validate that the alert does not contain Unexpected Low Traffic. We can add in another rule to negate the CPU as well.
 
Granted yes this is a manual effort, but if you know the dates and the scopes, you can automate it via the API as well.  
 
I hope this helps everyone this holiday season

Hi everybody. I've had a browse and can't seem to find an answer around synthetics behaviour, so was hoping someone could help.
When setting up synthetics for a user process in a single page application, is Dynatrace able to capture the wait time a user experiences in their browser for a process-heavy JavaScript application?
For example, if a large amount of data is received from a web service that might take 50 seconds to process for a browser in IE compatibility mode, but only 10 seconds in pure Edge mode. Would Dynatrace reflect this in the synthetic performance profile?
I'm also assuming that Synthetics does not actually process the JavaScript that runs in a single-page application for a given browser in order to give a 100% accurate representation of what the user experiences?
Many thanks in advance,
Keith

Fairly new to log monitoring, we are doing a POC with it. Anyone find it strange you cannot see the EXACT filename unless you actually setup the custom log source configuration rule to have an exact path (aka not using wildcards).Let's say I have any number of directories (the list is never static) within the folder structure below. Within those directories I have a file by the name of <some_name.log> I could do something like /logs/*/*/*.log to capture all of these files but then when I query within logs and events in dynatrace, I see the log.source value as the custom log source rule matcher I setup, in this example '/logs/*/*/*.log'.I thought the whole purpose of a log monitoring tool was to be able see the exact file the issue occurred in but instead with dynatrace I would have to still logon to the host and do my own greps to find the file where the message was logged from. I'll also add that yes you can automate the log source rules via api calls (to create the exact matcher) but are we really expected to have potentially hundreds of matchers and then also have to worry about when a new directory is spun up, adding that new matcher?I could very well be missing something here, looking for feedback here.Example folder structure below. Note, within each directory can be any number of directories which within them, could have any number of log files./logs/sbx/logs/devlogs/test/logs/qa

I've been updating Postman collections for myself for a while to make it easier to work with the Dynatrace API across multiple clusters, tenants, and environments.
 
I have put the files on github now, maybe someone will find it useful.
 
Setup is very quick, then you can just select the request and environment against which to execute it.
 
Here is a short guide:
  Import collections
Postman is available for free from postman.com.
Import (file -> import) the collection .json files for the APIs you want:

Environment API v1
Environment API v2
Configuration API
Cluster API v1
Cluster API v2

A separate collection for each, including all requests of that API, will be created:

    Create environments
For each of your Dynatrace environments/tenants you want to use, add a postman environment via manage environments -> add:

 
The environment needs two variables (names are case sensitive!):

DT_HOST

URL to the environments

For managed: your-dt-domain.com/e/Environment-ID

example.com/e/b80b158e-ev23-4330-30fcc-c4391bbx6ce2


For SaaS: Env-ID.live.dynatrace.com

abc133769.live.dynatrace.com






DT_TOKEN

An API token for the environment



 
    Request away!
Now you can open any request and easily execute it against different Dynatrace environments by selecting the environment on the top right:

I would like to export my graphs contained in a dashboard to create a PDF. I know about the Export to PDF feature, but it doesn't quite meet my needs. The Export feature exports the dashboard as it looks on the screen, so you get a 1-page snapshot. I'd like the graphs to be bigger in the export, so each of the graphs would span the whole page width, ending up with a column view of all my graphs that would span multiple pages.
I understand that this would be difficult, so as an alternative, I was wondering if there is a way to get the graphs through the API, as either a PNG, PDF, or some other graphic format. I can get the data from the API, but don't think I can get the graphic. This would then allow me to combine them into my own document.

- If you see that log events are trimmed to the Maximum ingest of Log Events limit set for this environment, you need to increase it.
- If log ingest was below the limit in subsequent intervals, your log entries will be re-ingested and should be available later, but you could consider increasing the limit to avoid a delay in data processing.
 
But how do I do that ? How do I know in which case I am ? In my Environment Log Viewer, am I supposed to find or not find something related to "dt.ingest.warnings" ? Or is it supposed to be investigated through "Format Table" field named "trimmed" ? In which case what am I supposed to find or not find ?

Hi Folks,
I have found a Go application in OpenShift (redhat costmanagement-metrics-operator) with inactive deep monitoring because of rule 47.
 
Is there any connection between rule 47 and Go monitoring settings second item?
 
 
Does rule 47 override the Go monitoring settings second item? Or there is not connection between them?
Does anyone have experience about this topic?
Thanks in advance.
Best regards,

I have integrated Dynatrace SDK into our iOS application. When I run our application locally or download it from Testflight, everything works perfectly. I can see our real Apdex rating, web requests, and crashes if any.However, when I release our into production and it is on the Appstore, Dynatrace doesn't show any date.No web requests or crashes. Also, Apdex is 1.0 as a result.
Our cost and traffic control is 1% which shouldn't be an issue because Dynatrace works fine in our Android application. We use the same dashboard for both platforms.
- We have Firebase in our app but we don't use it for Performance Monitoring, I have disabled it just in case but it didn't help.

I can't find an SDK to read the user's IAM roles. Currently, I'm having to do a bunch of error handling and presenting Toast when a user is missing a role. It would be much more preferable to be able to query whether a user has the necessary roles, so the UX can be tailored to what they can do. For example, if they lack a permission for an API call, disable the button that would fire that call.

What is and How to generate a HAR File?How to enable dtHealthCheck.What is and How to generate a HAR File?  A HAR (HTTP Archive) file is a log of all network requests made by a web page in your web browser. It includes details about each request, such as the URL, response headers, request headers, and timings. Generating a HAR file is a useful troubleshooting tool because it provides a comprehensive snapshot of a web page's network activity, allowing for precise issue identification. How to generate a HAR file: This tutorial covers Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. (For webview, see this tutorial.)Step 1: Open the Developer Tools.Open the Browser.Press F12 on your keyboard to open Developer Tools.Alternatively, right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element."For Chrome, you can also use the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the browser > More tools > Developer tools.Step 2: Go to the "Network" Tab and check the Preserve log checkbox.In the Developer Tools, you should see a set of tabs at the top. Click on the "Network" tab. Make sure the "Preserve log" checkbox is checked. This option keeps the network log intact even after a page refresh or navigation.Optionally, you can clear the network log by clicking the "Clear" button. ∅  Chrome and Edge:  Firefox:  Step 3: Reload the Page or Trigger the Actions.To capture all network activity on the webpage, you'll need to reload the page or perform the specific actions that trigger the network requests you're interested in (e.g., submitting a form, clicking a link, etc.).Step 4: Stop Recording.Once you've captured the network activity you need, return to the "Network" tab in Developer Tools. You should see a list of network requests made by the webpage.Click the red "Stop" button (square icon) in the top-left corner of the "Network" tab to stop recording network activity. - Chrome and Edge:   - Firefox: | | Step 5: Export the HAR File.Right-click anywhere in the list of network requests.Select "Save as HAR with content" (Chrome and Edge). "Save All As HAR" (Firefox). Choose a location on your computer to save the HAR file, give it a descriptive name, and click "Save."How to enable dtHealthCheck. dtHealthCheck is a feature enabled by adding the User-Agent header value dtHealthCheck. Responses to any requests made with this header contain additional headers and sometimes an HTML marker in the body. If injection problems occur, these headers provide diagnostic details, which may help us to identify the issue. (It only works for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge). Step 1: Open Chrome or Edge Developer Tools.Open the Browser.Press F12 on your keyboard to open Developer Tools.Alternatively, right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element."For Chrome, you can also use the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the browser > More tools > Developer tools.Step 2: Access Network Conditions. There are two ways of opening Network Conditions. 1 - In the Developer Tools, you should see a set of tabs at the top. Click on the "Network" tab. In the additional settings bar, click the "More network conditions..." icon (the one with a yellow square), and the Network conditions will open.2 - In the Developer Tools pane, locate and click the three vertical dots (Options) in the top-right corner of the pane. Choose "Network conditions" from the dropdown menu. Step 3: Untick "Use browser default" and Customize User-Agent to "dtHealthCheck".In the "Network conditions" settings, you'll find an option called "User agent." Untick the box that says "Use browser default" to enable manual User-Agent configuration.After unticking "Use browser default," a dropdown menu will appear. Select "Custom..."A text field will appear where you can enter a custom User-Agent string. Enter "dtHealthCheck" into this field. Step 4: Open the webpage.As soon as you set the User-Agent to "dtHealthCheck" in the "Network Conditions" settings, it should take effect for the currently open tab, and you can proceed to open or reload the webpage and create the session. (Do close the tab or browser. Once it's closed, the option will reset to default).Step 5: Export the HAR File.Right-click anywhere in the list of network requests.Select "Save as HAR with content" (Chrome and Edge).Choose a location on your computer to save the HAR file, give it a descriptive name, and click "Save."Note: The dtHealthCheck will only show results if the OneAgent is working on the web server. Keep in mind that it doesn't work for Agentless injection.

I'm seeking a DQL query that provides detailed insights into log ingest. Currently, without Grail, we can observe log volume based on the number of log lines. However, Grail measures logs by size. Although the default Grail UI displays the previous log lines count, I'm interested in a DQL query that offers log ingest information based on size. Additionally, I'd like the query to break down the data by log.source and dt.process.name so that I can gain a comprehensive understanding of my sources in relation to their respective sizes.
In my opinion, I believe that since Grail now considers the size of logs, enhancing the UI to display both volume/lines and size would be a valuable improvement.

I have to type:'>' then type "host" THEN type the 'hostname' to find a single host.  how does this add anything to my experience?  Why wouldn't I just go to hosts then find the host, there?Please fix.  I really used the ability to open search text in the entire tenant. I find the inability to use it a very strong negative in recommending this product. Thanks,

useful tip for using Dynatrace effectively to monitor and troubleshoot your applications:**Tip: Set Up Custom Alerts for Critical Business Transactions**While Dynatrace provides automatic anomaly detection and alerting for various metrics, it's essential to create custom alerts for your critical business transactions. These are the transactions that directly impact your business's success, such as user registration, checkout processes, or specific API calls.Here's how to set up custom alerts for critical business transactions:1. **Identify Critical Transactions:** Determine which transactions are vital for your business. These might be revenue-generating transactions, user engagement actions, or any other key performance indicators.2. **Define Custom Thresholds:** Custom thresholds allow you to set specific performance criteria for each critical transaction. For example, you might set a threshold for response time, error rate, or throughput.3. **Configure Alerting:** In the Dynatrace dashboard, go to the "Alerting" section and create custom alerts for your critical transactions. Set up alerts based on your defined thresholds. You can configure notifications via email, Slack, or other channels.4. **Include Contextual Information:** When creating alerts, consider adding contextual information, such as the affected application, service, or user impact. This helps your team understand the urgency and context of the alert.5. **Test and Refine:** After setting up alerts, perform testing to ensure they trigger when expected. Tweak the thresholds if necessary to strike a balance between avoiding false alarms and catching critical issues.6. **Collaborate and Automate:** Ensure that relevant team members are notified when critical alerts are triggered. Consider integrating alert notifications with your incident management and collaboration tools for seamless incident response.By setting up custom alerts for your critical business transactions, you can proactively identify and address performance issues before they impact your users and business operations. This helps you maintain a high level of application reliability and user satisfaction.

Dynatrace discontinues support for the Chrome and MS Edge browser extension by January 2024 as remotely hosted code will no longer be allowed for those browsers.
 
The SaaS vendor RUM browser extension will soon no longer be hosted in the Chrome store as remotely hosted code is being disallowed by Google. As a result, the JS Agent will no longer pass the Chrome store review process. By January 2024, browser extensions cannot be used and will be deleted from the Chrome store. However, Dynatrace has solutions available for customers on a case-by-case basis. 
Read more:1. Overview2. What it means to our customers 3. Timeline 4. Alternative Solutions 
- - -1. Overview 
One of the consequences of the rollout of Manifest Version 3 for Chrome and Microsoft Edge  extensions is that remotely hosted code will no longer be allowed. An extension will only be able to execute JavaScript that is included within its own package. Because we inject the JS Agent into the customer’s page, and it’s not bundled with the browser extension, we will not pass the Chrome store review process beyond June 2023. Even if we were to bundle the JS Agent within the extension, it would most likely not be approved because we are using some functions that will not be allowed. - - -2. What it means to our customers 
This means that we will have to discontinue support for the extension and the customers who use our browser extension to inject data will not be able to do so any longer; the full sunset is in January 2024.   
- - -3. Timeline 
As of the first release of MV3 from Google in January 2023, Dynatrace can no longer update the extension. However, it will still function in the stable versions of Chrome but might be rejected in dev/beta/canary versions.   
In June 2023, the extension might also be rejected in stable Chrome versions, but the customers can disable the rejections for both of these scenarios with an Enterprise policy.  
Finally, in January 2024, the extension will no longer be usable even with an Enterprise policy, and all V2 extensions will be deleted from the Chrome store. 
 
- - -4. Alternative Solutions  
Depending on the type of customer application (e.g. Salesforce, Office 365 etc.), there might be other options such as Agentless monitoring with manual injection. We are aware that this solution might not work for all customers, and we’d have to look at applications on a case-by-case basis to see if there are other alternatives. For example, for Salesforce, we also have the option of using the Salesforce Streaming API.

I always had troubles getting this documentation page right:
Back up and restore a cluster | Dynatrace Docs
 
It starts explaining about Metrics and configuration storage with no clue about its underlying technology Cassandra.
Then it starts taking about ElasticSearch technology with no clue what its purpose is about and what kind of data it holds. We can only read it is uncompressed binary format.
 
Then it moves on talking about Transactional storage but it neither explains the technology nor the type of data in it. We can only read there is no back up for Transactional storage.
 
I found this thread was asking many of the questions I have but questions remained unanswered even though it says Solved for some reason.
Solved: Transaction storage on Dynatrace Managed - Dynatrace Community
 
My understanding so far is that:
 
Cassandra holds metrics data and it is backed up daily on each cluster node with 80% data compression.
ElasticSearch search holds session data, distributed traces, problems and configuration data with incremental backup every 2 hours.
 
What is Transactional storage about and what is the database technology involved?
What else am I missing?
 
Kindly refer to the community thread above and comment there.
Please also update the doc page.

Has anyone created any DPS Licensing dashboard yet?In demo we have a really cool Licensing Dashboard that I loved to use in my previous account. But now, I am running a DPS account, so the metrics are different.I was about to create a new dashboard, since found none created in demo, but facing hard time to understand the new metrics. So, has anyone already created one so I can borrow it?

So, I can turn OneAgent on or off on a particular host with a POST call to /api/v2/settings/objects as follows:   [
  {
    "schemaId": "builtin:host.monitoring",
    "value": {

IBM MQ ActiveGate Extension - Troubleshooting Steps in case of uninitialized or error 13. 
Dynatrace provides both Oneagent and ActiveGate extension (aka: remote monitoring). 
 
This article is specific to ActiveGate extension as mentioned here:
https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/ibm-mq-extensions#activegate
Possible error messages:
Status Uninitialized or Error 13: 
Can't access to "/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment/custom.remote.python.ibmmq_java/plugin.json" (filesystem error: status: Permission denied [/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment/custom.remote.python.ibmmq_java/plugin.json])
[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugindeployment/custom.remote.python.ibmmq_java/psutil/init.py'
 
Troubleshooting steps:
1. Make sure you have an Environment ActiveGate installed with all its default modules running. It is not allowed to have only extension 1.0 and 2.0 enabled while rest of the modules are switched off through custom.properties file. If this is the case please uninstall the ActiveGate (including all its files and folders) and reinstall it. 
2. If step (1) did not work, check the file permissions on /opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment/custom.remote.python.ibmmq_javaand change the file ownership and permission as follows:
Change the ownership of the directory to dtuserag:dtuserag and modify the permissions to 744: 
chown -R dtuserag:dtuserag /opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment/custom.remote.python.ibmmq_java
chmod -R 744 /opt/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/plugin_deployment/custom.remote.python.ibmmq_java
 
After changing the file ownership and permissions, please restart the remotepluginmodule service
systemctl restart remotepluginmodule
 
If the steps mentioned still did not work, please reach out the the product/tech support at Dynatrace. 
Thanks!

Dear Dynatrace Warriors.Hope you guys are doing well. 
Is it possible to Configure JVM Heap space memory monitoring and splitting by host/server? Instead of monitoring the overall server process, how can I focus on the JVM heap space only for a specific server? I would like to get the details of this and showcase this on the Dashboard so that my team can monitor and review this. 
Look forward to your guys' response on this. Thank you so much for helping out guys.

I want to create a summary table that has 2 columns - the first column would be the name of the data, and the second would be the value. These values would be the min / max / average of various metrics over a given time period. Or, if this can't be done, maybe 4 columns - the first column to be the name of the metric, - the second to be min, - the third average, - fourth max. Whenever I try to do this I get a separate column for each calculation, which leads to a table with a lot of blanks in it. Any way to do this?

In this session, Dynatrace security researcher Mario Kahlhofer @mario_kahlhofer demonstrates security use cases from both the attacker and defender side using the open-source application Unguard.
Mario shows how an attacker:
Conducts target reconnaissance using open source fuzzers wfuzz and commixGains access to the insecure Unguard application into the Kubernetes clusterGains persistence using a reverse shellMaps the cluster, finding an insecure Redis serverCompletes the compromise by dumping information in RedisMario then demonstrates how a Defender can:
Use Dynatrace to see the distributed trace information for indicators of compromiseUse Dynatrace to efficiently categorize where to look for compromisesUse Dynatrace and Falco to see, in realtime, how an attack took place and what commands the attacker executedUse Dynatrace for post-incident forensic review – to understand the attack timelineLinks discussed in this webinar:Unguard: https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/unguard Falco: https://falco.org/ MITRE Att*ck: https://attack.mitre.org/

Hey all,
Wondering if anyone comes across trying to export response time distribution under a custom action for a single user session.For example, I would like to have the info of CPU time & database sequential read time (highlighted in yellow) from the session and also the database call value (highlighted in green)Refer to the screenshot below:
 
Basically what we trying to achieve here is having the t-code (Session Manager ....), CPU time (125ms), database sequential read time (24ms) and database calls (231) to be displayed in the dashboard or exported somewhere for our performance analysis purpose. 
Looking forward to the reply .Thanks in advance.

Does Dynatrace close problems for gracefull shutdown after a certain amount of time even if the hosts are still down?Can I change this behavior somewhere in the setting?Thank you

This is agreat dashboard because it gives you all the info in a single glass pane view, now the problem is each of the tiles is tiny and you cannot even make out the X or Y axis labels, can we please have a click button on any tile that will simply expand the tile into a large view {pop up} at the moment i have to click and go to explorer which is still ok but its a different view, why can we not just have the same view on a larger screen

Hi，
Does anyone know the proper way (gracefully) of shutting down a server?
Overview:

AIX server was shut down for maintenance purposes.
one agent is not running after restarting the server, later it was due to endpoint corruption which has been claimed was due to the server being shut down ungracefully.

Problems:

It was likely due to shutting down the server ungracefully. Hence I wanted to ask what's the way of shutting down the server gracefully.
As per documentation (https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform-modules/infrastructure-monitoring/hosts/monitoring/h...), shutting down properly would return as shutdown (in grey) NOT offline (in red). 
I have tried a few methods to shut down the server, however, all returned as OFFLINE (in red) which implies an ungracefully shutdown.

Below are the shutdown methods I have tried:
-Shutdown via virtual manager-Command shutdown-Command sudo shutdown-Command poweroff-Command init0-Command shutdown -P +1
Conclusion:

I wish to understand the proper way of shutting down the server which will return as SHUTDOWN not OFFLINE.
And also how Dynatrace classifies graceful and ungrateful shutdowns although we are using the correct shutdown events as per above.

Problem statement:I noticed that Dynatrace captured and counted periodical network activities like embedded chats as part of the loading duration. This creates false timings e.g. 100 sec instead of 10 sec for finishing functional XHRs. Or worse it leads to a timeout 180 sec. That's indeed not what is expected from the measurement of action duration.
As per support, there is no possibility to exclude requests from waterfall analysis.What are the capabilities of managing wich resources/xhr will be included in the duration and what is the best practice for adjusting measurements?

Hi,This page describes OneAgent features for Perl process monitoring:https://www.dynatrace.com/technologies/perl-monito...I'm not seeing any detailed metrics for my Perl processes, like descibed in the pic "Hard(ware) facts". Of course that is since deep monitoring for the process is disabled. And I can't enable it, since it's not even listed under the Supported Technologies settings. So far it seems like there is no actual support for additional metrics regarding Perl, it's just like any "unsupported" technology. The only visible difference is that Perl processes have a different logo compared to the processes labeled in the category "Other". The actual data is just the basic process metrics like Worker Processes, Responsiveness, etc. - but that's it. Am I missing something?

Hello Everyone
I hope this message finds you well. I'm currently working on configuring custom alerts in Dynatrace for our AWS resources, and I could use some guidance and advice from those who have experience with this tool. If you have expertise in Dynatrace or have faced similar challenges, your input would be greatly appreciated.
Here's a bit more context about my situation:
Objective: I want to set up custom alerts in Dynatrace to monitor specific AWS resources and trigger notifications when certain conditions are met. This will help us proactively address issues and optimize our AWS environment.
Challenges:


Understanding Metrics: I'm struggling with identifying the relevant metrics and thresholds to create effective alerts. Which AWS metrics should I be monitoring, and how do I determine the right thresholds?


Alert Configuration: Once I have identified the metrics, I'm not entirely sure how to configure the alerts within Dynatrace. What are the best practices for alert configuration?


Notification Integration: We use multiple communication channels for alerts, including email, Slack, and SMS. How can I ensure that Dynatrace integrates smoothly with these platforms for timely notifications?


False Positives: I want to avoid being flooded with false positives. Any tips on fine-tuning alert conditions to minimize unnecessary alerts would be incredibly helpful.


If you've successfully set up custom alerts in Dynatrace for AWS resources or have insights into any of the challenges I mentioned, please share your knowledge. Your experience will undoubtedly help not only me but also others in the community who might be facing similar issues.
Thank you in advance

Hello:We have a series of web pages that simply download PDF's.I contacted support today to ask why they did not show up under the pages or page groups defined for the website/application.I was told that "pages and page grouping will only appear if the RUM JavaScript agent is present, as those require a user action or page change to be attached to the events. These are just PDF files, so the browser simply loads the file with no HTML provided by the server." and that "if you wanted to monitor this you would have to wrap the loading of the PDF files in your own HTML to include the RUM JS Agent inside of it," Is there any other way to gain basic statistics on these types of pages?What we are really looking for is "how many times was the page accessed/viewed" This seems pretty basic. How can it be done in Dynatrace Thanks,Chris

Hi, 
Currently, i have notice an unusual amount of android 10 sessions. These sessions are usually web application sessions opened on a mobile using a chrome browser. 
After further read ups, i am aware that for web applications, Dynatrace uses the user agent string sent by the browser to distinguish user sessions of real users from synthetic and robots. It also leverages this string to identify operating systems and device types like desktop, tablet, or mobile.  
I also came across this article about Chrome's user‑agent reduction. In the article it states that "Starting in Chrome 110 (February 2023) we are gradually introducing a fixed value for Android version and device model—the default value will always be Android 10 on a model K". 
This leads to my suspicion that chrome's user-agent reduction might be the reason for unusual number of android 10 sessions. 
Does anyone else experience the same issue and if there is ways to counter it. Else would it be part of dynatrace's roadmap to fix this such that we get an accurate operation system. 
Thanks in advance!

How do we change the default port settings to 443 from 8443 for the cluster that set up a cluster version earlier than 1.166?
Changes in the required file.
The mentioned steps need to be followed.
NA



 

Environments preserve port settings from the previous versions.
Cluster version later than 1.166 exposes port 443 for incoming access from OneAgent as default.
There is no API or automated way of configuring the port setting for new nodes that get added to the cluster, i.e. They need to be manually configured from the CMC page as shown in the below screenshot.

 
 
 
Steps must be followed to change default port settings to 443 from 8443 for the cluster that set up a cluster version earlier than 1.166.:

The port value is taken from “security-Gateway/config.config.properties” from the seed node, which happens during the node installation.
To fix the issue, replace “port-override=8443” with “port-override=443” in the above file.
The configuration changes need to be made on all the nodes.
After this fix, the next newly installed node should use the 443 port.
If the warning message below appears, you can proceed with the configuration changes as this is an exception case.

 

You do not need “custom.properties” file to be changed and the configuration can be applied to the above-mentioned file.
There is no requirement to restart the server applications after implementing the changes as when a new node is installed, the installer asks the seed server for the ActiveGate configuration file, which is taken by the seed server directly from the disk.

Hello:I am trying to make sure I am reading a trace correctly. I had to redact some information for security purposes, but the stricture is the same in the trace. Please look at the images provided.We have an agent on both the database and the application server.In the first image we see that the database lists "Failed Requests" (not failed connection)1- Does this mean that the database server saw the request? Or is that information being populated from what Dynatrace gathered from the Application server (and then inserted it into the DB page/overview) In the second image I dive into one of the failed requests "Failed Request" traces from the image above.At the outermost layer is the Microservice.1 action.I then see Microservice.2 action (indented 1 level) make several successful requests from Database AFollowing that I see Database B attempt to be accessed. (and create an error)That last action in indented 1 level less than the Database A actions.So, does this mean it is part of Microservice.1 's actions?If so, is it showing that Microservice.1 waited to access Database 2 until Microservice.2 was completed? The last image is what shows up under the error message for trying to access Database B.It says it is a SqlClient Exception, but was it generated from the database itself? Or from the Microservice attempting to access it?  Thank you all so much for any clarifications.If you have any good suggestions for sources that delve into reading these traces with examples please share! Kindest regards,Chris

Does anybody have experience/suggestion how to route certificate alarms coming from cert extension (SSL Certificate Monitor | Dynatrace Hub)
I'm trying test and implement this extension which, after some applied fixes by Dynatrace, does what it should do. However I'm experiencing one big gap which support can't solve and suggesting an RFE which I can't imagine someone didn't solve it already.
The extension is detecting certificates on eg host and creates a custom device for each certificate. The extension is generating alarms once certificates are (going to be) expired. The problem is that I can't send these alarms to the right teams. I can't autotag these items eg based on the host they're detected on or the domain the certificate applies for.
Does anyone have experience with this and/or even solved this issue? I would have expected that via a entity selector rule using the relation or regex auto tag should be possible. Once autotagged the correct alarmprofile can be applied and alarms will be sent out to the right to solve the issue.
Looking forward seeing the responses,
Kind regards,
Daan

Dynatrace Community is built around customers’ needs. Why? Because the best product created is the one “co-created” with its users. This forum is a space for giving feedback, sharing ideas, and creating opportunities for learning. But not only for customers but also for Dynatrace employees who can have contact with direct users of the product.
Our Employee Member of the Month, Stefanie Pachner is one of the people who sees a lot of value in the cooperation between these two sides and that’s why she is involved by the heart by helping Community users.
How does she do it and what is the purpose behind it? We invite you to read more about the @stefanie_pachne ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Can you share some details about your past? What is your story, how it happened that you decided to work in the IT / APM area, and how did you become a Dynatracer?
When I was a girl, no one talked about cybercrime or IT security – that’s why I initially didn’t know how to fulfill my dream of working as a technical engineer in the area of law and order. I grew up in Upper Austria and liked the idea of programming and designing software so I attended the Higher Technical School in Perg and the University of Applied Sciences in Hagenberg. Early in my career, I came to Technical Support as it combines Engineering and Communication in a broad technical field. I joined Dynatrace Tech Support in 2015 and currently focusing on security topics after finishing my master’s in Information Security to make my dream come true. 
Can you tell us a little bit about your job? What exciting things you’re working on that you can share?
I love my job, also thanks to the flexibility, trust, and guidance given by Dynatrace, my manager Klaus Prückl, and the collaboration within the Global Technical Support team and with other teams like Product Security and Privacy. Recently, we worked on the Global CVE DB which has been publicly made available at cve-status.dynatrace.com. Generally, I am promoting the idea of customer self-service in different projects like proactively sharing knowledge with customers in the Heads-up from Dynatrace forum.What makes you excited about being a part of the Dynatrace?
In a nutshell - especially the vision of the product – we're revolutionizing the APM market with constant innovation.

How is the Community helping you in your job? Why do you think it’s worth being a part of the Dynatrace Community? What best advice can you give someone who just started using Community?
The Community allows customer self-service and reduces our Support afford.  
If you’re new to the Community, I suggest checking the User Guide and exploring the Troubleshooting and Ideas forums.
Tell us something about you that most people don’t know. What is your biggest joy or passion in life? 
My biggest passion is beach volleyball. I love to play with the Hagenberger beach volleyball team or Dynatracers. And in winter, I enjoy skiing with family and friends. I also played soccer for a long time, and I am now focusing on teaching it to the U6 team (kids from 3-5 years). LEFT: Dynatrace playing beach volleyball tournament at Business Cup Perg. / RIGHT: Austrian Winter Wonderland, where I love to ski in winter.
What’s one thing on your bucket list? Your dream?
Continue traveling the world once kids are ready to, snorkeling again on the Maldives in awesome coral fields or with whale sharks. And before that, hold time still when kids have a cute moment  - with best greetings, especially to all working parents of “crazy” little kids out there. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Stefanie, thank you for everything you do.

Hi,I want to give access to a few specific users to monitor their applications in a "soft way".The idea would be to hide the "problems" view from and other menus/dashboards to avoid being contacted by these users while we work on resolving the current issues.Have you been faced with this kind of situation? any idea on how to manage it?Thank you,Moh.

Dynatrace 1.261 introduced new API /api/v2/monitoringstate  for querying status of monitoring for process group instances. At first sight this looks as a replacement for legacy process group API v1.It seems this API is not yet in the documentation , @jaroslaw_orlows can you give a look?
I'd like to ask folks using the API already how can you use it on a larger scale?
I ran into two issues severly limiting usage of this API:

API does not support pagination and the response is limited to 500 entities. How do you use it? Querying entities indivudually is not really an effective way of API usage.
API does not seem to support filtering for monitoring state itself - typically I need to query processes where there an issue (like severity equals warning). There is just the healthState(UNHEALTHY) - which does not reflect the monitoring state.

now to monitor them via oneAgent extension is easy,but if I like to send the traffic to AG and then to Dynatrace, do I only need to put the URL of the AG(and how to get the URL of AG)in this case I believe the AG needs to be publicly accessible as well, correct?

I'm new to Dynatrace so bare with my dumb questions here 
What I need is to make Dynatrace to watch a very simple log file in text format , check for a specific value and raise an alert if found.
So far I was able to specify a custom log source under a process that produces my logs but it seems Dynatrace does not want to monitor it. Why is that?
 
Also , I stumbled across log processing rules and I 'm struggling to create my own to simply find a word sequence there. All examples seems related to known logs from web servers like nginx /haproxy and includes some pretty complex data manipulation. Plus, It seems that logs should be in JSON format? At least that what's required for Rule Testing section..
I have a feeling that I've missing something obvious here - can you point me to the right direction how can I:
- add a text log file to Dynatrace
- add a rule to simply check for words "exit code XXX"
- raise an alert

Hello,
I am currently using Couchbase 7.x as my database, and it exposes metrics through the Prometheus Node Exporter on the /metrics endpoint, the database is deployed on a virtual machine hosted in the cloud.
I have been searching for materials or extensions that explain how to retrieve these metrics using Dynatrace, but I have been unsuccessful in finding any.
Additionally, I wanted to inquire if there is a way to simplify the process of importing these metrics into Dynatrace. Is there a method similar to the RabbitMQ extension where manual coding of each metric is not required?
Thank you for your assistance.

I found the way to do it via the v1 API (and it's extremely straightforward...), but as that will one day be deprecated, I'd prefer to write my query to use a v2 method (assuming it exists) so that I don't have to come back to the script years later and have to update it.
v1 method:
Web application configuration API - GET key user actions | Dynatrace Docs
I can query via the Monitored Entities v2 API and get a list of all User Actions for an application, but there's no way I can tell to determine if that action is marked as a Key User Action or not... 
I've tried poking around the Settings v2 API, and the closest thing I found there is a list of Apdex settings for an Application, but those appear to only be the fallback settings for the entire application (i.e. for user actions that aren't marked as Key).  I'm guessing Key User Actions will show up in that same section if we've customized an Apdex threshold for them, but that's kind of the whole point of this script, so we haven't yet.
So is the functionality to get a list of just the Key User Actions for a specific Application not present in the v2 API yet, or am I missing something?
 
Extra Context:
In case it isn't clear, I'm writing a script that we can feed a list of Application names.  It will then loop through those and, for each application, get a list of all the Key User Actions.  Then, for each Key User Action, determine what the average VCT was over a certain timeframe (like last 7 or 14 days or whatever), then calculate what the standard deviation was for that time period.  We can then use that to set Apdex thresholds for each Key Action where the Tolerating threshold is maybe 2 standard deviations above average and the Frustrated is 3 or 4 standard deviations above (it's kind of crazy that Dynatrace doesn't do this for us automatically....  Are we really expected to manually determine the thresholds for each Key User Action for all of our Applications?).

Hello.
I am on managed 1.274.157.20230908-165051 + OneAgent v1.267.155.20230629-142023+. We moved to log Classic kinda recently.
I have a process group with Dynatrace UI showing auto-detected log files : 
 
 
...
/myFSLocation/var/log/tomcat/abcd2/abcd2-daily.log
/myFSLocation/var/log/tomcat/abcd2/abcd#-daily.log (File is not included in log monitoring, some log records may be missing)
...
 
 
 

I double checked /myFSLocation/var/log/tomcat/abcd2/abcd2-daily.log does comply with dynatrace monitorability prerequisit, including being appended at least each minute. 
FYI: we have some other logs for which uploading does work. Like for /myFSLocation/var/log/tomcat/abcde/abcde-daily.log (note : no number in log file name).
FYI : the "Maximum ingest of log events per minute" is high enough.
Though, we don't get any content being uploaded for this abcd2-daily.log log. I mean zero content, zero lines in.

Could we be exposed to an issue with log rotation detection (https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/log-rotation-patterns) ? Any one experienced this ? Any idea ?
Regards.

Working with logs within Azure, we had some issues with Log Management and Scale. We would find ourselves hours behind real time. There was no real documentation on how to scale based on GB/hour. Then we noticed this link that provided some information (much to what we kind of sized and presumed anyway):
Azure Logs | Dynatrace Docs
However,  as we use this now for guidance, there are NO updates for Grail that seem to be dated and we think that our previous sizing templates may not be big enough/sized right for Grail. ie, we have been selective in the past, but now considering pushing more and retaining more.
I'd like to know your experiences if possible. There are no significant documentation updates, so presume the figures still stand.

Hello Dynatrace Community!
Last month, we asked you to help us by sharing your valuable feedback in the Community Survey. We didn't expect it to get as much response as it did, and we can't put into words how grateful we're. But we'll try!
Thank you, everyone, from the bottom of our huge cube-shaped hearts 
 
 
Below, we'd like to share the main areas of improvements we identified based on the feedback you provided, our ideas and plans to address them.
 



AREAS
IDEAS

User Groups
For partners

Hebrew

 


Polish

 


Southern hemisphere, English speaking

 


More activity in user groups

Activity in user groups lays outside the responsibility of the Community team. We provide the space for users to connect, but it's on owners and members to keep the group alive. We will pass the feedback to owners of user groups, and will be happy to help with advise anytime!


More visibility of the area

We will investigate ways of making this area more visible to our Community.


Events and Webinars
Lots of feedback on this area that gave us the confirmation that full review and re-invention of this area is due.

It's on our roadmap!


Forum features and bugs
Community chat

Our Community by design doesn't have a chat feature turned on for all users, as we'd like to keep all knowledge and conversations between users public, so more people could use that exchange.


See questions with no reply/solution


You can see all questions with no reply by using the "Without reply" filter on the main feed:
 
On separate sub-forums, you can use "Unanswered questions" for the same, and "Without solution" to see threads with no comment accepted as a Solution.
 
It's available from the level of a sub-forum only, unfortunately, for the moment.



Built-in dark mode


Unfortunately, there's no possibility to introduce a dark mode built-in feature as of now. If our platform provider ever introduces such functionality, we will definitely adopt it, too 
Follow the Product idea to get updates.
For now, you can use a workaround solution described in this post.



Filtering by date

You can filter by date by using either "Most recent" (for lastly commented on posts) or "New topics" filters on each level of our forum: 


Pro Tips to be allowed to be marked as Solution

No such functionality, unfortunately, but for all authors of the Pro Tips in Dynatrace Tips space we have a special prize in shape of additional bonus points  


Zoom links in webinars in Outlook not working/are missing


We created a ticket for our platform provider to investigate this issue and fix it.
As a workaround, add the event your calendar, and on the day of the event follow the link to the Community you have in the invite - we always make sure the Zoom link is available in the description.



Option to "Outdate" content

The topic of outdated content is on our roadmap, but in the meantime you can simply let the Community team know that a post needs to be archived. We do our best to do it proactively, but any help is appreciated.


Option to "Close" the topic


Same as with outdated content, we will investigate what can be a solution for such a use case.
In the meantime you can ask the Community team to archive or simply close comments on your posts.



Improve readability of huge threads


As for now, we cannot provide a solution beside two filtering options available under each thread - Newest to oldest, and Oldest to newest.
We raised a product idea on the forum of our platform provider, so hopefully one day 



Option to "feature" posts instead of publishing the link in the comments


Unfortunately, there's no functionality that can support this use case.
And on the other hand, we would like authors of posts to be able to accept all additional resources (documentation links, other posts on the Community, video, etc.) as Solutions, and it won't be possible with the "feature" function.



Option to filter product ideas based on status


You can see all ideas with a particular status by clicking on the status name:
 
 
Unfortunately, there's no way to see the list of ideas with all statuses except for one.



Personalized main page with an option to view only new content in followed sub-forums/labels


Personalization of content is already on our roadmap  Follow this product idea for updates.
DONE: read here.



Missing content
More video content focused on the upcoming features

Not in the hands of the Community team, but we have passed the feedback to people creating this type of content.


More video content focused on tips and tricks

Not in the hands of the Community team, but we have passed the feedback to people creating this type of content.


Use cases and best practices

Creating more content around use cases and best practices is on the roadmap.


Best practices with detailed explanations/configuration examples


It lays outside the responsibility of the Community team, as authors of content are choosing to provide examples and explanations.
What we can do from our side - investigate ways of making such content more valuable for the Community and share those tips  



Demos from different domains

Not in the hands of the Community team, but we have passed the feedback to people creating this type of content.


More content on Cloud best practices

Not in the hands of the Community team, but we have passed the feedback to people creating this type of content.


Weekly digest of the hottest content

We're working on making our newsletters content more valuable   You can expect some changes in the upcoming months!


Product ideas and Feedback area
More feedback channels (related to major product areas)

While we can't promise there will be a Feedback thread on every new feature of Dynatrace, we continuously work with our Product Managers to expand this sub-forum 


All channels to be up-to-date and well-maintened

The Community team at least once a year runs an extensive clean up of Feedback channels, and archives those that are left unattended. We are working on making the collaboration between PMs and the Community even smoother in the future 


More engagement from Dynatrace employees

This is not something that can be done at once as a project, but the Community team is working on involving more Dynatrace experts in the knowledge-sharing on the Community.


New spaces
Latest Dynatrace


It won't be a separate sub-forum, but you can find content specific to new Dynatrace under the label "latest Dynatrace", or under other specific labels.
More in the article.



DQL


Our survey took place before the change went live, but DQL sub-forum is now a place! 
Check it out here.



Workflows and automations


Spoiler alert: it's already in the works! You can expect the announcement soon.
In the meantime, check out helpful materials we've gathered for you 



Notebook


There's no plan to make a separate space for this content.
Notebooks are a part of Dashboarding, and it's a default place for all questions related to that topic. 



App engine

Developers forum is the place to go to learn about creating apps on the Dynatrace Platform 


Grail

There's no plan to make a separate space for this content.


Monaco

There's no plan to make a separate space for this content.


General feedback
Recognition and appreciation for active users

As we did in the past a few times, we will plan some prizes for future Community challenges, for example SWAG store vouchers!


Vouchers for the Dynatrace certification

We will investigate if it's possible. Lets keep it a surprise 


Extra points for Pro Tips

Every author of an article on the Dynatrace Tips and Tricks sub-forum already gets extra bonus points  


Identify partners and customers on the forum (as it is with Dynatracers)


There's no plan to provide any kind of identification for prospects, customers and partners on our forum. 
A workaround is to provide this information in "Bibliography" section of your profile:
 
 




 
We'd like to also thank everyone for the ocean of compliments you showered our forum with, and all the kudos given to the team. Nothing makes us happier than seeing our work make a difference 
 
If you have any questions or further suggestions for our Community, you can leave them in the comments

What can you expect to see in this post:
Announcements and events New learning App releasedRelease highlights for App developersUseful resources 
 
 Announcements and events
 
As mentioned in our previous newsletter, we’ve got a new event in store for you this month. We’re kicking off our new Dynatrace App office hours event series on September 12. This office hours session will be available for any developer with a question regarding app development. In this session, you can expect news, learn more about Dynatrace Apps, and get your burning answers to your questions.
 
To attend, you'll need to register for the event; visit the Community Events page.
 
 
 
 New learning App released
 
More often than not, developing a Dynatrace App involves using our new Dynatrace Query Language (DQL) for querying data stored in Grail. To make it even easier to get started learning DQL, we’ve now released a new hands-on on App with interactive tutorials. It’s never been this easy to learn DQL!
Try it for yourself, or install the App today on your own environment. Want to learn even more about DQL? Join our DQL community or have a closer look at the DQL language reference. 
 
 Release highlights for App developers
 
React Hooks [0.1.0] 
 
To make it easier to add React Hooks functionality to your apps, we've released a new package to cover some of your basic needs, such as interacting with Grail, Documents, or the App State.
To learn more about adding React Hooks to your app, visit the React Hooks documentation.
 
App utils [0.3.1] 
 
With the latest release we've introduced a breaking change in this package. The 2nd parameter in functions.call was changed. For a full overview of the interface including the changed parameter, visit the App utils documentation. 
 
Design System [0.101] 
 
With the latest release we've introduced some breaking changes in the TextInput component. TextInput now uses compound components for Prefix and Suffix and the forwarded ref now uses an imperative handle (of type InputRef) to allow access to the wrapper element and the input element. A migration is provided for using the prefix and suffix icons and renaming the inputRef prop to the new ref prop. The migration also changes simple usages of the old ref type, but for more complex scenarios it might still be necessary to migrate manually.For information on how to easily migrate, see the design system changelog.To learn more about the TextInput component, visit the TextInput documentation.
 
Design System [0.102]
 
In this package version we've introduced a new MeterBarChart component, that allows you to display a horizontal bar that fills according to the percentage value of a measure.To learn more about the MeterBarChart component, visit the MeterBarChart documentation. Another new component we’ve released as part of this version is the FeatureHighlight component. This component supports the onboarding of new users, as well as the introduction of new features to existing users.To learn more about the FeatureHighlight component, visit the FeatureHighlight documentation.

We have a public API and no control of the casing that clients use when using the API. The problem that we see is the '/api/project' and '/api/Project' are treated as different requests. We've used request naming rules as a workaround for this but that feels like a very clunky solution as we have to do them individually for each request that we care about.
 
Is there a way to turn off case sensitivity for detected web request names for a service?

Hi all,
For a customer it would be ideal if I could get an access token with custom policies instead of the pre-set write settings.
I need a token with two very specific policies assigned to it. Edit alerting profiles and edit notifications. Is it possible to connect tokens and policies or select a custom scope of tokens? As far as I know, policies are specific to user accounts but maybe someone has an idea or I am missing something.  Help is greatly appreciated!

 When I met Viachaslau Balashevich, I immediately noticed how communicative and what a people person he was. He admitted he liked discussion and different people, as much as challenging them! Can only confirm that during our meeting he was challenging me as well.  
We spoke about many things: the product, the industry, the people from the IT world, but also about the importance of being human, not a machine or a robot these days. The common thread of the conversation was the value of constantly asking yourself the question “Why?”, and the critical thinking as a concept that Viachaslau believes in and represents. 
Without further ado, I’d like to invite you to get to know our Community Member of the Month - @Viachaslau. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Can you share some details about your past? What is your story, and how it happened that you decided to work in the IT / APM area?   
When I was a child, like many other young boys, I dreamed about outer space. I grew up on books by Ayzek Asimov, Gary Garrison, Frank Herbert, and many others.    
After school, my path to IT could have been more straightforward. Initially, I got 2 higher educations: In History and Social science and later in International Law. It was helpful to lead my own small business in the construction area. Leading my own company resulted in having an introduction to IT. We needed a website and administration. So, it was on me to set this up. After my freelance period, I decided to go “all-in into IT” and chose to follow several IT courses. Finally, I was able to work on some severe IT projects.  
In my current project, I was introduced to Dynatrace as an APM tool for mobile and web applications. Some developers were concerned about its code customization which felt like a “burden” to them and diverted them from “real code”, but for me, it was and is a great tool that can show the fair product state and quality of systems and applications in real-time.  Scrum in the real world - product is changed in your hands. LEFT: I have some idea…. / RIGHT: MVPCan you tell us a little bit about your professional life? Where do you work, and what do you do in your job? And how does Dynatrace fit into the picture?   
I have been working at EPAM Systems for more than 7 years. Currently, I’m the IT Solution Architect Monitoring & Observability for Motorola Solutions, helping them in their digital transformation journey. One of my primary responsibilities is to care for the observability of the entire IT ecosystem. Dynatrace plays a key role in this process by supplying reliable data, based on which we can set up quality gates and deep information for operations.   Hobby and travel. LEFT: We have no mountains in the Netherlands, but we can still climb. / RIGHT: I like travel – it helps me to get new ideas and relax.What was the biggest challenge Dynatrace helped you to overcome?   
The challenging task is to build a forecast for product quality and predict problems. I must detect problems in real-time and create impact analysis as quickly as possible to limit the impact of those problems. Luckily, Dynatrace helps in this with significant amounts of built-in and custom metrics. What brought you to our Community? What made you stay? What best advice can you give someone who just started using Community? My primary stimulus for joining the Community was and still is experience exchange.  And now the Community is also helping me to find answers to non-standard questions. Tell us something about you that most people don’t know. What is your biggest joy or passion in life? 
We live close to the sea, there are a lot of parks in my city. My favorite hobbies are playing volleyball, cycling along the dunes, and having activities with my Family.  Once upon a time in the summer LEFT: Have no dog yet but like to be a dog-sitter for friends. / RIGHT: Our volleyball community.
What’s one thing on your bucket list? Your dream? 
My dream is to imagine a world without wars, where we will be focused on making life better, longer, healthier without poverty and struggling to get basic things. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Viachaslau, having you as one of the Community users celebrating the critical mindset is a real value, both for our Community and for Dynatrace. Looking for different perspectives and choosing the best one makes Dynatrace a better product. More is yet to come, so we’re looking forward to more challenging from you

Hi!
We are using Generic DB Query Plugin and its behavior is strange - it is not working according to the documentation and configuration settings.
While there was just one endpoint and one query, everything worked as expected. There was one metric, and we customized the metadata for it - pretty name, units (seconds), dimensions, panels, and alerting.
Then, we created one more endpoint, that is completely different - it is gathering data from another database, with different metrics, dimensions, etc. Data is ingested correctly (based on the logs), but everything from all the queries is now mixed within that first metric created. Ie no new metrics are created from the value columns, all that is gathered is added to the first metric, and it is a mess.
Plugin documentation states that different metrics will be created. When I reached the Dynatrace team, they explained that the plugin could (for some reason) create only one metric and we are expected to differentiate by splitting. But how do we use different unit types (seconds, count, etc.) if this is a single metric? Alerting also works strangely as it triggers on data coming from various queries.
Does anybody have experience of using the DB Query Plugin with multiple databases and queries? How do we split the feeds into different metrics? Or is there an alternative to this plugin?
Thank you!

I also modify lightly dbquery_extension.py and plugin.json to be able to configure a endpoint of that new defined type.
It didn't works yet but the stranger thing is that i didn't found any errors even in deep diving logs into C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Temp\dynatrace-ag-dbquery

My fellow DynaMight  Patrick Hofmann pahofmann has shared several Postman collections for the different Dynatrace API's with the community. 
Encouraged by this because I use them daily, I created a Postman Collection for the new Account management API following the guidelines used in the ones created by Patrick. 
I share the steps to get this working in your Postman client.
 


1. Create an Oauth2 Client in Dynatrace
For more reference in this step you can take a look at this post from @AgataWlodarczyk with a video from @adam_gardner 


Open the User menu and select Account settings (in latest Dynatrace, Account Management).


On the top navigation bar, go to Identity & access management > OAuth clients.


Select Create client.


Provide an email of the user who owns the client.


Provide a description for the new client.


Select the required token scopes. These are the scopes that the client will be able to grant. Tokens generated by the client might have different scope sets.

Allow read access for identity resources (users and groups) account-idm-read
Allow write access for identity resources (users and groups) account-idm-write
Allow read access for environment resources account-env-read
Allow write access for environment resources account-env-write
Allow read access for usage and consumption resources account-uac-read
Allow write access for usage and consumption resources account-uac-write
Allow IAM policy configuration for environments. iam-policies-management; iam:policies:read; iam:policies:write; iam:bindings:read; iam:bindings:write; iam:effective-permissions:read.



Select Create client.


Copy the generated information to the clipboard. Store it in a password manager for future use.


 
2. Create an Environment for your Collection in Postman
 
 Environment

Select Environments.
Click the + sign.
Name your Environment.
The environment needs that you define these variables:

DT_CLIENT_ID Provided when you create the Oauth2 client in step 1.
DT_CLIENT_SECRET Provided when you create the Oauth2 client in step 1.
DT_ACCOUNT_URN Provided when you create the Oauth2 client in step 1.
DT_UUID Same value of DT_ACCOUNT_URN but stripping the urn:account:
DT_SCOPE A list of required scopes separated by a whitespace.
DT_TOKEN_URL  PLEASE DON'T CHANGE THIS VALUE  The URL https://sso.dynatrace.com/sso/oauth2/token where you need to obtain your Bearer token after create the Oauth2 client.
DT_TOKEN_NAME The name for your token.
DT_TOKEN In this variable you will store your assigned dynamic token.
DT_HOST  PLEASE DON'T CHANGE THIS VALUE  The URL api.dynatrace.com of the Dynatrace API for Account Management.


Leave this Environment Selected.

 
3. Import Dynatrace Account Management API Collection
 
 Import

Download the Dynatrace Account Management JSON from the repository.
Select Collections.
Click on Import and choose the previously downloaded JSON.
Your Dynatrace Account Management API v1 Collection has been added to your collection.

 
4. Get your Bearer Token
 
 Get your Bearer Token

 DON'T FORGET TO HAVE SELECTED THE ENVIRONMENT CREATED IN STEP 2 
Select your recently imported Dynatrace Account Management API v1 Collection.
Click on the Authorization tab.
Click on Get New Access Token.
Wait until the token has been collected.
Click on Use Token.
 BE SURE TO SELECT ALL YOUR TOKEN  And then select Set as variable.
Choose the DT_TOKEN variable to store your new Bearer Token.

 
5. Ready, Set, Go 
 
 Using Collection

 DON'T FORGET TO HAVE SELECTED THE ENVIRONMENT CREATED IN STEP 2 
Select Collections.
Then Select the Request you want to use and check the parameters.
Click on Send.
And if everything goes well you get your Response.

In this exciting new series called DynaLabs, Technical Product Specialists from Dynatrace ONE will get hands-on with the Dynatrace platform, tackling one capability at a time!
"DQL" stands for Dynatrace Query Language. It is a powerful tool to explore your data and discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, create statistical modeling, and more based on data stored in Dynatrace Grail storage, the data lakehouse where the data is stored.
In this DynaLabs session, Dynatrace ONE Technical Product Specialist Milos Pejic @mpejic covers Dynatrace DQL and Workflows. We start by learning about the basics of DQL, such as how to create queries, filter results, and aggregate data. Then, we cover how to use DQL to create workflows, which are automated processes that can be used to monitor and troubleshoot applications. Finally, we will put our knowledge to the test by creating a simple workflow that monitors the performance of a web application.

Hi All,Has anyone successfully integrated Dynatrace to the status API for Twilio?Details and dashboard here: https://status.twilio.com/apiJSON call (no authorization needed) here: https://gpkpyklzq55q.statuspage.io/api/v2/summary.jsonWith so many SaaS vendors (including Dynatrace) now offering status pages, I would really like to start taking advantage of these in Dynatrace. I played around with Synthetics on it, but found that the options are too limited for what we would want.I was thinking of going the custom plugin route, but I am not sure how feasible that would be due to the fact that really all metrics within Dynatrace are really based on performance and in this case we would be looking for for of an event.Looking at an example of the JSON returned, I would like to capture the components "name" and the "status" of each component. Then raise a problem if the status is anything but "operational" and then of course provide some detail in the problem that is raised such as the name, the status, along with a link back to the Twilio status page.{    "page": {        "id": "gpkpyklzq55q",        "name": "Twilio",        "url": "https://status.twilio.com",        "time_zone": "America/Los_Angeles",        "updated_at": "2020-11-02T05:16:15.468-08:00"    },    "components": [        {            "id": "ys1jhy2ys04z",            "name": "Group Rooms",            "status": "operational",            "created_at": "2019-01-10T08:35:00.743-08:00",            "updated_at": "2020-09-24T22:11:38.577-07:00",            "position": 1,            "description": null,            "showcase": false,            "start_date": null,            "group_id": "31pkbykrvbwr",            "page_id": "gpkpyklzq55q",            "group": false,            "only_show_if_degraded": false        },        {            "id": "g2dt752kwqs0",            "name": "PSTN",            "status": "operational",            "created_at": "2016-04-08T13:28:39.348-07:00",            "updated_at": "2020-10-09T08:10:00.822-07:00",            "position": 1,            "description": null,            "showcase": false,            "start_date": null,            "group_id": "j3s4w3gnsj08",            "page_id": "gpkpyklzq55q",            "group": false,            "only_show_if_degraded": false        },        {            "id": "b9z92qjr2p04",            "name": "TaskRouter",            "status": "operational",            "created_at": "2015-03-23T08:51:24.916-07:00",            "updated_at": "2020-10-29T12:46:36.773-07:00",            "position": 1,            "description": "Twilio TaskRouter service",            "showcase": false,            "start_date": null,            "group_id": "p750yl3t5mwk",            "page_id": "gpkpyklzq55q",            "group": false,            "only_show_if_degraded": false        },Curious if anyone has tried to approach this with Dynatrace?Thanks!

Hello community, good day.
We have been working on enabling monitoring for multiple Azure web apps (Azure app services). These are all NodeJS apps that run on Linux-based platforms plans on Azure.
However after instrumentation, we have received no information about the user sessions, we double checked and the RuxitAgent JS script is being injected correctly on all web pages. So we checked again the documentation and it says something about a potential conflict with App insights.
So we have been trying to disable App insights, in our case only the Azure functions have them enabled. But so far no luck even after disabling Insights. Is it also needed to deploy oneagent on the functions?

This works great but we run our VM's as Immutable Cattle, So when a NEW deployment occurs the KeyRequest is lost as it is tied to Outgoing Service entity ID.  The NEW VM is now under a NEW service entity ID and will require another "Mark as Key Request" to occur before Seeing in SLO. Even adding the SplitBy bridges the timeline but not any data untill the Mark as Key Request occurs again on new entity. This requires manual toil and automation outside of the event. Would making them Metrics (with DDU impact) resolve this permanently? Are there Other ways to accomplish This?

The documentation says:By default, Dynatrace alerts when average CPU usage is higher than 95% in 3 of 5 consecutive one-minute intervals or when usage is higher than 90% in a single five-minute interval.But, when we look at how we define custom settings for the CPU saturation settings, it seems to be based on the 10-second samples that are taken each minute: Now, even though the two approaches might seem similar, there are cases where it will not happen. Given that we don't have visibility into the 10-second samples (we do have the min/avg/max values), how do we know what is exactly happening with CPU saturation detection?BTW, remembers me of this Product Idea: https://community.dynatrace.com/t5/Product-ideas/RFE-Increase-resolution-of-data/idi-p/166920

In Extensions 2.0 concepts | Dynatrace Docs is defines a set of limits "per Instance". Furthermore, it defines an "Instance" as "Per instance shows the consumption volume for one data source in OneAgent and ActiveGate." - unfortunately, it doesn't define "data source"...
I think that the correct metric for the memory limit is dsfm:extension.engine."memory_used" which can be split several ways including:

dt.extension.ds
dt.extension.config.id

I struggled to find any documentation for either of these dimensions, but suspect that "Instance" relates to "dt.extension.config.id"? Does that make sense?

Hi,As Dynatrace developers its important to understand how metrics are sent to Dynatrace. Of course utilizing Dynatrace's OneAgent built-in detection is the first step to reaching observability. We also have access to intelligent extensions like Micrometer for building our own defined custom metrics through the Meter interface.
 
Micrometer Docs
Dynatace Micrometer Docs
 
If you are familiar with the separate APIs, there are actually multiple methods of metric ingestions between version 1 and version 2 of the API. Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe version 2 came out when the OneAgent was implemented?
 
I recommend checking out the Dynatrace Meter Registry source code. It provides a lot of interesting insight on how Micrometer sends metrics to the API. For example there are two exporters that correlate to the two API versions. 
 
Dynatrace Meter Registry code
 
 
Taking a look at the Dynatrace Meter Registry Builder object you can see the HttpUrlConnectionSender() method. This is used to configure your organization's proxy server on the registry. This method uses a unique Micrometer interface called HttpSender which enables build REST communication for Micrometer metrics.
 
Let's take a look...
 
Here you can see that we a Proxy parameter.
 
So you'll want to create a Bean method that builds a proxy-based Meter Registry. Furthermore, you'll want to obtain those proxy parameters via property files using the "@Value" parameter annotation.
@Bean
public DynatraceMeterRegistry myfunction(DynatraceConfig config, @Value("{com.foo.barr.dynatrace.proxy}")){
            your logic...
            return registry

Hello, so there is this legacy application in our company which runs Java Web Launcher (jp2launcher.exe) and several Chromium.exe processes. Unfortunately, this app gets stuck at random times when doing routine operations and it DOES NOT when OneAgent service is stopped. When it's stuck the jp2launcher.exe usually stays eating a lot of CPU. So clearly Dynatrace somehow interferes with it. We tried making Custom process monitoring rules to exclude those processes:Do not monitor if EXE name begins with "jp2launcher"Do not monitor if EXE name begins with "chromium"but it doesn't seem to have any effect. We also disabled Real user monitoring for jp*launcher process group, but with no effect.application currently stuck and Java Web Launcher using CPU endlessly: Affected systems: w2k19 server and w2k16 server, but probably it doesn't matter.Upgrading Java is not easy as the app relies on the specific version. Currently there are either jre1.8.0_341 or 1.8.0_371 on these servers.Any ideas what to do except having these few affected servers entirely excluded from Dynatrace?

Hello,
 
I have an issue with Trace menu.
 
I have a service that gives back a response between 200 OK or 400 Bad Request. When the return is 200 OK, the Trace menu will bring up other service information with details. When it returns, 400 Bad Request brings up this message.
 
Trace diagnostic messages






 
Some data could not be collected or transmitted. This is most likely due to a resource congestion on network, host or process level in your monitored environment (Diagnostic code: C0)


 
Required information was not sent by the OneAgent. If this happens regularly, this might indicate a OneAgent bug (Diagnostic codes: C6, A6)






 
What can I do? currently I have updated dynatrace oneagent version 1.271.135. Thank you.

Information about the Synthetic Screenshots: Reference screenshots are taken when the monitor is created or edited, and subsequently, every 24 hours from a random monitoring location.Screenshot retention is based on execution retention. They are considered part of the execution data for the execution when they were taken. The default retention time for screenshots is 35 days, however, it can be less in some Managed Environments depending on their storage settings.Screenshots are captured at the end of each script event, even those without timings.Success (expected) screenshots are only taken on the first execution, so if your monitor is always successful and has no screenshots, it is possibly always on a re-run.You can verify the origin of a screenshot by following these steps:Navigate to the Synthetic dashboard and click on "Analyze executions."Select the specific execution you're interested in from the list.Above the screenshot, you will find a label displaying the date and location, indicating, "Screenshot from <date> in <location>."Click on this link, and you will be instantly directed to the execution where the screenshot was taken or attempted to be taken. Example: Troubleshoot: — Both Dynatrace SaaS and Managed (Public and Private Locations):Confirm that the executions are not always re-runs. Go to the Synthetic, click on “Analyze executions”, and in the execution time, select different timings and confirm the “Execution type” is standard (and not re-run) for some of the executions.— Dynatrace SaaS (Private Locations - Stores screenshots in S3):Ensure that the ActiveGate can access the Amazon S3 service.The following domains in the firewall configuration must be allowed:ruxit-synth-screencap.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com for screenshot storage.ruxit-synth-screencap.s3.amazonaws.com for screenshot access and viewing.— Dynatrace Managed (Public Locations:):Note: Cluster-side screenshot storage is the default for newly created Managed Clusters since version 1.216.Make sure the endpoint below is allowed to receive data on your Cluster ActiveGate: /beacon/synthetic/screenshot/[uuid] - Where uuid is the Environment ID.— Dynatrace SaaS and Managed (Private Locations):How to identify issues in the logs:In the browser_#.log file (/var/tmp/dynatrace/synthetic or %PROGRAMDATA%\dynatrace\synthetic):Look for any errors related to "SCREENSHOT" or "SCREENCAP." These errors are related to taking and storing the screenshots locally on the Virtual User Controller (VUC).In the vuc-browser.log file. (/var/log/dynatrace/synthetic/ or <LOG>/synthetic/log or %PROGRAMDATA%\dynatrace\synthetic\log):Check for "[SCREENCAP]" errors.

Thought this would be easy 
Currently combining 4 Dynatrace environments (1 for each of our AWS estatesDEV->UAT->STG->PRD), into 1 environment, then using MZ to split the data.
I created 4 MZ rules, and used the AWS account ID to split the data, but this is not reflected in Services / Traces etc.? I would of thought that logically a service running on ECS would just be connected without any hassle? But none of my services show when I select a MZ - so it seems I also need to tag these as well.
Can I tag at our activegateway? Or use the gateway id as a way to split data into MZ?
Frustrated, should be easy

Hello,
My question is about relative and absolute JavaScript URLs. We have a website monitored by OA, and it has automatic injection that works perfectly. However, there is an issue when the site uses a login page hosted outside our domain, and the client is redirected to perform the login and then returns to our site. On the redirection page (the one without our agent), we encounter a 404 error with the Dynatrace JavaScript files, and the URL for downloading them is changed to that redirected site, most likely because it's relative. So, my question is, can we ensure that the JavaScript files are downloaded with absolute URLs?   any suggestion to approach that scenario ?

Hi! Does anyone know if it's possible that the dt-app server serves the generated production bundle instead of the dev bundle? I can build it with npx dt-app build --prod , however it doesn't seem that there is a possibility to serve it then 
Starting a webserver doesn't do the trick because usually the dt-app / whatever does some magic, so some scripts / css files etc. cannot be found if I simply serve it with another server
But maybe it's also super easy and I don't see it :mild-panic:
My use-case is that I'd like to check the performance of my app, but in development mode React does some things that aren't necessary in production so this would negatively impact the analysis. Any idea how to achieve that?

Is there a way to programmatically define custom entry points for creating distributed traces as part of .NET application code?  My current company uses Dynatrace and we have to work with the operational team to use some sort of UI within Dynatrace to discover classes and select a particular method.  Developers are not given access to this functionality (it sounds global rather than scoped to our apps).  If developers refactor our code, we can break this making the integration fragile.By comparison, competitor's products (NewRelic and DataDog) offer .NET nuget packages that we can just annotate and method and we're done.  What's the equivalent for Dynatrace?  Can OpenTelemetry help me out here somehow?Thanks much

----------------
337:

Hello, we're using OpenTelemetry to auto instrument several Java applications running on Websphere Application Server.
However the issue we have is that some of the services appear with a too general endpoint name.
It seems that the span name is generated with a generic http.route attribute that is masking part of the whole request, so the endpoint name that appears in Dynatrace is equally generic and broad. Only when viewing the details of the trace/span, we can see the actual http.target and the real URI of the request.
Example:
http.route says /example/*.go
http.target is /example/login.go
 
The endpoint name ends up being only GET /example/*.go
This causes that all the traces/spans that share that same generic http.route are being grouped incorrectly inside that endpoint when they are very different URIs and requests.
 
We would like to have the endpoint name called GET /example/login.go
So the endpoint would correctly group only those login requests inside it.
We're using the new Unified Service capabilities to enrich the OpenTelemetry information and its representation in Dynatrace Services.
We're using auto-instrumentation OpenTelemetry for Java.
Any ideas?
Regards,
JD
